REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports
PHP 5.1.0 or above. Yii has been tested with Apache HTTP server
on Windows and Linux operating systems.

Please access the following URL to check if your Web server reaches
the requirements by Yii, assuming "YiiPath" is where Yii is installed:

      http://hostname/YiiPath/requirements/index.php


QUICK START
-----------

Yii comes with a command line tool called "yiic" that can create
a skeleton Yii application for you to start with.

On command line, type in the following commands:

        $ cd YiiPath/framework                (Linux)
        cd YiiPath\framework                  (Windows)

        $ ./yiic webapp ../testdrive          (Linux)
        yiic webapp ..\testdrive              (Windows)

The new Yii application will be created at "YiiPath/testdrive".
You can access it with the following URL:

        http://hostname/YiiPath/testdrive/index.php
